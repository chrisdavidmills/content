The overarching theory of **User-centered design** (UCD) is that everything we do as designers (and developers!) is for the user — understanding their needs, solving their problems, making their experience on the web better. This article provides an introduction to UCD, the kind of research you can do to better understand your user's needs, how UCD intersects with accessibility, and the common design patterns you'll encounter on the web.

- Understand that everything we do is for the user.
- Intro to user research/testing, and user requirements.
- Design for accessibility — consider the target audience and what additional needs they may have. Design for those from the very start.
- Understand what design patterns are, and the common patterns used on the web, for example:
  - Dark mode.
  - Breadcrumbs.
  - Cards.
  - Deferred/Lazy registration.
  - Infinite scroll.
  - Modal dialogs.
  - Progressive disclosure.
  - Progress indication on forms/registration/setup.
  - Shopping cart.
