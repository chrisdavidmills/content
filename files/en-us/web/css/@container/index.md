{{CSSRef}}

The **`@container`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [at-rule](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_syntax/At-rule) is a conditional group rule that applies styles to a [containment context](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_containment/Container_queries#naming_containment_contexts).
Style declarations are filtered by a condition and applied to the container if the condition is true.
The condition is evaluated when the queried container size, [`<style-feature>`](#container_style_queries), or scroll-state changes.

The {{cssxref("container-name")}} property specifies a list of query container names. These names can be used by `@container` rules to filter which query containers are targeted. The optional, case-sensitive `<container-name>` filters the query containers that are targeted by the query.

Once an eligible query container has been selected for an element, each container feature in the `<container-condition>` is evaluated against that query container.

## Syntax

The `@container` at-rule has the following syntax:

```plain
@container <container-condition># {
  <stylesheet>
}
```

For example:

```css
@container (width > 400px) {
  h2 {
    font-size: 1.5em;
  }
}

/* with an optional <container-name> */
@container sticky-heading scroll-state(stuck: top) {
  h2 {
    background: purple;
    color: white;
  }
}

/* multiple queries in a single condition */
@container (width > 400px) and style(--responsive: true) {
  h2 {
    font-size: 1.5em;
  }
}

/* condition list */
@container card (width > 400px), style(--responsive: true), scroll-state(stuck: top) {
  h2 {
    font-size: 1.5em;
  }
}
```

### Values

- `<container-condition>`

  - : An optional `<container-name>` and a `<container-query>`. Styles defined in the `<stylesheet>` are applied if the condition is true.

    - `<container-name>`
      - : Optional. The name of the container that the styles will be applied to when the query evaluates to true, specified as an {{cssxref("ident")}}.
    - `<container-query>`
      - : A set of features that are evaluated against the query container when the size, [`<style-feature>`](#container_style_queries), or scroll-state of the container changes.

- `<stylesheet>`
  - : A set of CSS rules or declarations.

### Logical keywords in container queries

Logical keywords can be used to define the container condition:

- `and` combines two or more conditions.
- `or` combines two or more conditions.
- `not` negates the condition. Only one 'not' condition is allowed per container query and cannot be used with the `and` or `or` keywords.

```css
@container (width > 400px) and (height > 400px) {
  /* <stylesheet> */
}

@container (width > 400px) or (height > 400px) {
  /* <stylesheet> */
}

@container not (width < 400px) {
  /* <stylesheet> */
}
```

### Named containment contexts

A containment context can be named using the {{cssxref("container-name")}} property.

```css
.post {
  container-name: sidebar;
  container-type: inline-size;
}
```

The shorthand syntax for this is to use {{cssxref("container")}} in the form `container: <name> / <type>`, for example:

```css
.post {
  container: sidebar / inline-size;
}
```

In container queries, the {{cssxref("container-name")}} property is used to filter the set of containers to those with a matching query container name:

```css
@container sidebar (width > 400px) {
  /* <stylesheet> */
}
```

Details about usage and naming restrictions are described in the {{cssxref("container-name")}} page.

### Descriptors

The `<container-condition>` queries include [size](#size_container_descriptors) and [scroll-state](#scroll-state_container_descriptors) container descriptors.

#### Size container descriptors

Size container descriptors are specified as-is inside the `<container-condition>`, for example:

```css
@container (width > 400px) { ... }
```

- `aspect-ratio`

  - : The {{cssxref("aspect-ratio")}} of the container calculated as the width to the height of the container expressed as a {{cssxref("ratio")}} value.

- `block-size`

  - : The {{cssxref("block-size")}} of the container expressed as a {{cssxref("length")}} value.

- `height`

  - : The height of the container expressed as a {{cssxref("length")}} value.

- `inline-size`

  - : The {{cssxref("inline-size")}} of the container expressed as a {{cssxref("length")}} value.

- `orientation`

  - : The [orientation](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/orientation) of the container, either `landscape` or `portrait`.

- `width`
  - : The width of the container expressed as a {{cssxref("length")}} value.

#### Scroll-state container descriptors

Scroll-state container descriptors are specified inside the `<container-condition>` within a set of parentheses following the `scroll-state` keyword, for example:

```css
@container scroll-state(scrollable: top) { ... }
@container scroll-state(stuck: inline-end) { ... }
@container scroll-state(snapped: both) { ... }
```

- `scrollable`

  - : Queries whether the container can be scrolled in the given direction via user-initiated scrolling, such as by dragging the scrollbar or using a trackpad gesture. In other words, is there overflowing content in the given direction that can be scrolled to? Valid `scroll-state` keywords include:

    - `none`
      - : The container cannot be scrolled in any direction.
    - `top`
      - : The container can be scrolled towards its top edge.
    - `right`
      - : The container can be scrolled towards its right-hand edge.
    - `bottom`
      - : The container can be scrolled towards its bottom edge.
    - `left`
      - : The container can be scrolled towards its left-hand edge.
    - `x`
      - : The container can be scrolled horizontally towards its left-hand and right-hand edges.
    - `y`
      - : The container can be scrolled vertically towards its top and bottom edges.
    - `block-start`
      - : The container can be scrolled towards its block-start edge.
    - `block-end`
      - : The container can be scrolled towards its block-end edge.
    - `inline-start`
      - : The container can be scrolled towards its inline-start edge.
    - `inline-end`
      - : The container can be scrolled towards its inline-end edge.
    - `block`
      - : The container can be scrolled in its block direction towards its block-start and block-end edges.
    - `inline`
      - : The container can be scrolled in its inline direction towards its inline-start and inline-end edges.

    To evaluate a container with a `scrollable` scroll-state query, it must be a scroll container. If the test passes, the rules inside the `@container` block are applied to descendants of the scroll container.

- `snapped`

  - : Whether a container is, or will be, snapped to a [scroll snap](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_scroll_snap) container ancestor along a given axis. Containers designated as scroll snap targets on which the [`scrollsnapchanging`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollsnapchanging_event) event is firing will match the `snapped` descriptor. Possible values are:

    - `none`
      - : The container is not a scroll snap target for its ancestor scroll container. The `none` value negates the matching â€” containers that _are_ snap targets for the scroll container will _not_ have the `@container` styles applied, whereas non-snap targets _will_ have the styles applied. This is true even if the ancestor is not designated as a scroll snap container (for example, by having a suitable {{cssxref("scroll-snap-type")}} value set on it).
    - `x`
      - : The container is a horizontal scroll snap target for its ancestor scroll container, that is, it is snapping horizontally to its ancestor.
    - `y`
      - : The container is a vertical scroll snap target for its ancestor scroll container, that is, it is snapping vertically to its ancestor.
    - `block`
      - : The container is a block-axis scroll snap target for its ancestor scroll container, that is, it is snapping to its ancestor in the block direction.
    - `inline`
      - : The container is an inline-axis scroll snap target for its ancestor scroll container, that is, it is snapping to its ancestor in the inline direction.
    - `both`
      - : The container is a horizontal and vertical scroll snap target for its ancestor scroll container, that is, it is snapping to its ancestor in both directions. With a value of `both`, the container won't match if it is only snapping to its ancestor along the horizontal _or_ vertical axis. It needs to be both.

    To evaluate a container with a `snapped` scroll-state query, it must be a container with a scroll container ancestor. If the test passes, the rules inside the `@container` block are applied to descendants of the container.

- `stuck`

  - : Whether a container with a {{cssxref("position")}} value of `sticky` is stuck to an edge of its scrolling container ancestor. Supported keywords include physical and {{glossary("flow relative values")}}:

    - `none`
      - : The container is not stuck to any edges of its container.
    - `top`
      - : The container is stuck to the top edge of its container.
    - `right`
      - : The container is stuck to the right-hand edge of its container.
    - `bottom`
      - : The container is stuck to the bottom edge of its container.
    - `left`
      - : The container is stuck to the left-hand edge of its container.
    - `block-start`
      - : The container is stuck to the block-start edge of its container.
    - `block-end`
      - : The container is stuck to the block-end edge of its container.
    - `inline-start`
      - : The container is stuck to the inline-start edge of its container.
    - `inline-end`
      - : The container is stuck to the inline-end edge of its container.

    To evaluate a container with a `stuck` scroll-state query, it must have `position: sticky` set on it, and be inside a scroll container. If the test passes, the rules inside the `@container` block are applied to descendants of the `position: sticky` container.

    It is possible for two values from opposite axes to match at the same time:

    ```css
    @container scroll-state((stuck: top) and (stuck: left)) { ... }
    ```

    However, two values from opposite edges will never match at the same time:

    ```css
    @container scroll-state((stuck: left) and (stuck: right)) { ... }
    ```

## Examples

### Setting styles based on a container's size

Consider the following example of a card component with a title and some text:

```html
<div class="post">
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Card title</h2>
    <p>Card content</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

A container context can be created using the `container-type` property, in this case using the `inline-size` value on the `.post` class.
You can then use the `@container` at-rule to apply styles to the element with the `.card` class in a container that's narrower than `650px`.

```js hidden
const post = document.querySelector(".post");
const span = document.createElement("span");
span.textContent = ".post width: " + post.clientWidth + "px";
post.parentNode.insertBefore(span, post.nextSibling);
// update on resize
window.addEventListener("resize", () => {
  span.textContent = ".post width: " + post.clientWidth + "px";
});
```

```css hidden
span {
  display: block;
  text-align: center;
}
.card {
  margin: 10px;
  border: 2px dotted;
  font-size: 1.5em;
}
.post {
  border: 2px solid;
}
```

```css
/* A container context based on inline size */
.post {
  container-type: inline-size;
}

/* Apply styles if the container is narrower than 650px */
@container (width < 650px) {
  .card {
    width: 50%;
    background-color: gray;
    font-size: 1em;
  }
}
```

### Creating named container contexts

Given the following HTML example which is a card component with a title and some text:

```html
<div class="post">
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Card title</h2>
    <p>Card content</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

First, create a container context using the `container-type` and `container-name` properties.
The shorthand syntax for this declaration is described in the {{cssxref("container")}} page.

```css
.post {
  container-type: inline-size;
  container-name: summary;
}
```

Next, target that container by adding the name to the container query:

```css
@container summary (min-width: 400px) {
  .card {
    font-size: 1.5em;
  }
}
```

### Nested container queries

It's not possible to target multiple containers in a single container query.
It is possible to nest container queries which has the same effect.

The following query evaluates to true and applies the declared style if the container named `summary` is wider than `400px` and has an ancestor container wider than `800px`:

```css
@container summary (min-width: 400px) {
  @container (min-width: 800px) {
    /* <stylesheet> */
  }
}
```

### Container style queries

Container queries can also evaluate the computed style of the container element. A _container style query_ is a `@container` query that uses one or more `style()` functional notations. The boolean syntax and logic combining style features into a style query is the same as for [CSS feature queries](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_conditional_rules/Using_feature_queries).

```css
@container style(<style-feature>),
    not style(<style-feature>),
    style(<style-feature>) and style(<style-feature>),
    style(<style-feature>) or style(<style-feature>) {
  /* <stylesheet> */
}
```

The parameter of each `style()` is a single `<style-feature>`. A **`<style-feature>`** is a valid CSS [declaration](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_syntax/Syntax#css_declarations), a CSS property, or a [`<custom-property-name>`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/var#values).

```css
@container style(--themeBackground),
    not style(background-color: red),
    style(color: green) and style(background-color: transparent),
    style(--themeColor: blue) or style(--themeColor: purple) {
  /* <stylesheet> */
}
```

A style feature without a value evaluates to true if the computed value is different from the initial value for the given property.

If the `<style-feature>` passed as the `style()` function's argument is a declaration, the style query evaluates to true if the declaration's value is the same as the computed value of that property for the container being queried. Otherwise, it resolves to false.

The following container query checks if the {{cssxref("computed_value")}} of the container element's `--accent-color` is `blue`:

```css
@container style(--accent-color: blue) {
  /* <stylesheet> */
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> If a custom property has a value of `blue`, the equivalent hexadecimal code `#0000ff` will not match unless the property has been defined as a color with {{cssxref("@property")}} so the browser can properly compare computed values.

Style features that query a shorthand property are true if the computed values match for each of its longhand properties, and false otherwise. For example, `@container style(border: 2px solid red)` will resolve to true if all 12 longhand properties (`border-bottom-style`, etc.) that make up that shorthand are true.

The global `revert` and `revert-layer` are invalid as values in a `<style-feature>` and cause the container style query to be false.

### Scroll-state queries

Scroll-state container queries allow you to selectively apply CSS rules to a container's children based on a scroll-state condition. Some of the conditions relate to the container themselves, and some relate to their scrolling ancestor. Let's look at a quick example involving the `stuck` scroll-state declaration, which evaluates whether a container with a {{cssxref("position")}} value of `sticky` is stuck to a specified edge of its scrolling container.

In this example we have a scrolling {{htmlelement("article")}} containing structured text, which includes {{htmlelement("header")}} elements containing [`<h2>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements) elements:

```html
<article>
  <h1>Sticky reader with scroll-state container query</h1>
  <section>
    <header>
      <h2>This first section is interesting</h2>
    </header>

    ...
  </section>

  ...
</article>
```

We want the headers to stick to the top of the scrolling container when they reach it, but also be styled differently as a result. First of all, we apply a {{cssxref("position")}} value of `sticky` to the `<heading>` elements to achieve the sticking effect. We also apply a {{cssxref("container-type")}} value of `scroll-state` to establish them as scroll-state query containers, and a {{cssxref("container-name")}} so we can explicitly target these containers with a container query.

```css
header {
  background: white;
  position: sticky;
  top: -1px;
  container-type: scroll-state;
  container-name: sticky-heading;
}
```

Next, we set up the query by defining a `@container` block. We include the `container-name` value set in the above rule so the query only affects those named containers, and specify the query as `scroll-state(stuck: top)`. This query states that the styles contained within the `@container` block are only applied to matching elements inside the containers when the containers are stuck to the top edge of their scrolling ancestor (the document's `<html>` element, in this case).

```css
@container sticky-heading scroll-state(stuck: top) {
  h2 {
    background: purple;
    color: white;
    box-shadow: 0 5px 5px #0007;
  }
}
```

Note that you can apply styles to descendants of the container when a container query matches, but not the container itself. This is why we are targetting the styles to the `<h2>` children of the `<header>` elements, not the `<header>` elements themselves.
