{{APIRef("Web Authentication API")}}{{securecontext_header}}

The **`signalCurrentUserDetails()`** static method of the {{domxref("PublicKeyCredential")}} interface signals to the authenticator that a particular user has updated their user name and/or display name.

## Description

It is possible for the information stored in a user's authenticator about a [discoverable credential](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API#discoverable_credentials_and_conditional_mediation) (for example, [a passkey](https://passkeys.dev/)) to go out sync with the relying party's server. This can occur when the user updates their user name or display name on the relying party's site without updating the authenticator.

The next time they try to sign in with a discoverable credential, the credential will still be presented to them with the old user name/display name in the relevant UI, which can result in a confusing user experience.

To avoid this issue, `signalCurrentUserDetails()` should be called on the relying party site each time a user updates their user account details or signs in, to tell the authenticator that the user information has been updated. It is up to the authenticator how to handle this information, but the expectation is that it will synchronize its user information with the provided update.

## Syntax

```js-nolint
signalCurrentUserDetails(options)
```

### Parameters

- `options`
  - : An object representing the updated user information, which contains the following properties:
    - `displayName`
      - : A string representing the updated user [`displayName`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions#displayname).
    - `name`
      - : A string representing the updated user [`name`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions#name_2).
    - `rpId`
      - : A string representing the [`id` of the relying party](/en-US/docs/Web/API/PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions#id_2) that sent the signal.
    - `userId`
      - : A base64url-encoded string representing the [`id` of the user](/en-US/docs/Web/API/PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions#id_3) the credentials relate to.

### Return value

A {{jsxref("Promise")}} that resolves to {{jsxref("undefined")}}.

### Exceptions

The promise rejects with a `TypeError` {{domxref("DOMException")}} if the `userId` is not a valid base64url-encoded string.

## Examples

The following snippet shows typical usage of `signalCurrentUserDetails()`:

```js
// Feature detection
if (PublicKeyCredential.signalCurrentUserDetails) {
  await PublicKeyCredential.signalCurrentUserDetails({
    rpId: "example.com",
    userId: "M2YPl-KGnA8", // base64url-encoded user ID
    name: "a.new.email.address@example.com", // username
    displayName: "John Doe",
  });
} else {
  // Encourage the user to update their details in the authenticator
}
```
