{{APIRef}}

The **`decoding`** property of the {{domxref("SVGImageElement")}} interface provides a hint to the browser as to whether it should perform image decoding synchronously or asynchronously.

## Value

A string representing the decoding hint. Possible values are:

- `"sync"`
  - : Decode the image synchronously for atomic presentation with other content.
- `"async"`
  - : Decode the image asynchronously and allow other content to be rendered before this completes.
- `"auto"`
  - : No preference for the decoding mode; the browser decides what is best for the user. This is the default value, but different browsers have different default values â€” Chromium defaults to `"sync"`, Firefox defaults to `"async"`, and Safari seems to use different values in different circumstances.

## Usage notes

In theory, this property provides a hint to the browser as to whether it should perform image decoding along with other tasks in a single step (`"sync"`), or allow other content to be rendered before this completes. (`"async"`). In reality, the `decoding` attribute for APIs is often not that useful, and there are often better ways of handling this.

For images that are not downloaded before being inserted into the DOM, the browser will likely render the empty image initially, and then handle the image when it is available, independently of the other content anyway.

For images that are downloaded before being inserted into the DOM, using the {{domxref("HTMLImageElement.decode()")}} method is a better way to assure atomic presentation without holding up other content.

## Examples

In the below example, you'll likely get an empty image shown on the page as the image is downloaded. Setting `decoding` won't prevent that.

```js
const SVG_NS = "http://www.w3.org/2000/svg";
const svg = document.querySelector("svg");

const img = document.createElementNS(SVG_NS, "image");
img.decoding = "sync";
img.setAttribute("href", "img/logo.svg");
svg.appendChild(img);
```

Inserting an image after download can make the `decoding` property more relevant:

```js
async function loadImage(url, elem) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    elem.onload = () => resolve(elem);
    elem.onerror = reject;
    elem.src = url;
  });
}

const SVG_NS = "http://www.w3.org/2000/svg";
const svg = document.querySelector("svg");

const img = document.createElementNS(SVG_NS, "image");
await loadImage("img/logo.svg", img);
// Using `sync` can ensure other content is only updated with the image
img.decoding = "sync";
svg.appendChild(img);
const text = document.createElementNS(SVG_NS, "text");
text.textContent = "Image is fully loaded!";
svg.appendChild(text);
```

A better solution, however, is to use the {{domxref("SVGImageElement.decode()")}} method to solve this problem. It provides a way to asynchronously decode an image, delaying inserting it into the DOM until it is fully downloaded and decoded, thereby avoiding the empty image problem mentioned above. This is particularly useful if you're dynamically swapping an existing image for a new one, and also prevents unrelated paints outside of this code from being held up while the image is decoding.

Using `img.decoding = "async"` may avoid holding up other content from displaying if the decoding time is long:

```js
const SVG_NS = "http://www.w3.org/2000/svg";
const svg = document.querySelector("svg");

const img = document.createElementNS(SVG_NS, "image");
img.decoding = "async";
img.setAttribute("href", "img/logo.svg");
svg.appendChild(img);
```
